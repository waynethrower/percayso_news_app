# Percayso Programming Exercise 3

## Brief

Create a website that gets news from the GNews api:

    https://gnews.io/?ref=apilist.fun
    
Your website must:    
      
  1) Include a search area
  2) Include a results area
  3) Include tests
  4) Be hosted on a publicly accessible URL, so we can see it working

You are free to choose:

  1) How to style all aspects of the page.
  2) What language and framework to use.

We are looking to understand your approach to solving this problem as much as the actual technical solution. Add comments to your code to help us understand your thinking. 

Googling syntax is allowed, googling solutions is not.

## Submitting your solution

Please commit your solution within the time frame given to you, even if your solution is not complete. We will be interested in seeing how you approached the problem.

## Extra credit

If you're in the mood for showboating, plese feel free to show us what else you can do. E.g. you could automate tests for your solution.
